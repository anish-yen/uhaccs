# Installing react-webcam

The `react-webcam` package has been added to `package.json`. To install it, run:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

This will install `react-webcam` along with all other dependencies.

## After Installation

Once installed, the WebcamView component will use `react-webcam` which provides:
- Better cross-platform compatibility (especially for Mac)
- Automatic stream management
- Built-in error handling
- Simpler API

The camera should work seamlessly on Mac, Windows, and Linux after installation.
